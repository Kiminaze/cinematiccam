This script lets you activate an additional camera for you to use in FiveM.
You can set it on a specific position and angle relative to your camera and keep it there.

Features included:
- toggle the camera on / off
- moving and rotating on all axes
- setting precision movement of moving and rotating
- setting field of view
- applying / removing a filter
- setting filter intensity
- toggle minimap on / off

Planned features:
- using mouse input for rotation
- better calculations for much easier camera movement when camera is rotated
- “Presets” for fast choosing of a specific angle/filter etc.
- saving additional per-user presets
- Config-Option: Don’t attach it to player and instead have it completely free moving (idea by @Syntasu )
