--------------------------------------------------

**What exactly is the "Cinematic Cam"?**
The Cinematic Cam provides the user with an easy to use "additional" camera, that can be moved freely in the world. Additionally it can be attached to any npc/player/vehicle in the game in order to provide something similar to a "Dashcam" or just for fancy screenshots or videos.
You can set it on a specific position and angle relative to your character and the camera will move with the entity.

**Features included:**
- complete control using NativeUILua by Frazzle ( [NativeUILua](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua) )
